## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return *indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`*.

You may assume that each input would have ***exactly one solution***, and you may not use the *same* element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

## Examples

### Example 1
```text
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```

### Example 2
```text
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: Because nums[1] + nums[2] == 6, we return [1, 2].
```

### Example 3
```text
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 6, we return [0, 1].
```

## Constraints

- $2 \le \text{nums.length} \le 10^4$
- $-10^9 \le \text{nums}[i] \le 10^9$
- $-10^9 \le \text{target} \le 10^9$
- **Only one valid answer exists.**

## Follow-up

Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ time complexity?
