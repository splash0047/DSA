## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, rotate the array to the right by `k` steps, where `k` is non-negative.

## Examples

### Example 1
```text
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
```

### Example 2
```text
Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation: 
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]
```

---

## Constraints

- $1 \le \text{nums.length} \le 10^5$
- $-2^{31} \le \text{nums}[i] \le 2^{31} - 1$
- $0 \le k \le 10^5$

---

## Follow-up

- Try to come up with as many solutions as you can. There are at least three different ways to solve this problem.
- Could you do it in-place with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ extra space?
