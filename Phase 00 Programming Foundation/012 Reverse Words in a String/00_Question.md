## Problem Statement

Given an input string `s`, reverse the order of the **words**.

A **word** is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The **words** in `s` will be separated by at least one space.

Return *a string of the words concatenated by a single space in reverse order*.

**Note** that `s` may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

## Examples

### Example 1
```text
Input: s = "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"
```

### Example 2
```text
Input: s = "  hello world  "
Output: "world hello"
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
```

### Example 3
```text
Input: s = "a good   example"
Output: "example good a"
Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
```

## Constraints

- $1 \le \text{s.length} \le 10^4$
- `s` contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces `' '`.
- There is **at least one word** in `s`.

## Follow-up

If the string data type is mutable in your language, can you solve it **in-place** with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ extra space?
