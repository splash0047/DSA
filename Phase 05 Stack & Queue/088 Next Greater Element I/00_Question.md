## Problem Statement

The **next greater element** of some element `x` in an array is the **first greater** element that is to the right of `x` in the same array.

You are given two **distinct 0-indexed** integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, where `nums1` is a subset of `nums2`.

For each $0 \le i < \text{nums1.length}$, find the index $j$ such that $\text{nums2}[j] == \text{nums1}[i]$ and determine the next greater element of $\text{nums2}[j]$ in `nums2`. If there is no next greater element, then the answer for this query is `-1`.

Return *an array `ans` of length `nums1.length` such that `ans[i]` is the **next greater element** as described above*.

## Examples

### Example 1
```text
Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2]
Output: [-1,3,-1]
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
- 1 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. The next greater element is 3.
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
```

### Example 2
```text
Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [3,-1]
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. The next greater element is 3.
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
```

## Constraints

- $1 \le \text{nums1.length} \le \text{nums2.length} \le 1000$
- $0 \le \text{nums1}[i], \text{nums2}[i] \le 10^4$
- All integers in `nums1` and `nums2` are **unique**.
- All the integers of `nums1` also appear in `nums2`.

## Follow-up

Could you find an $\mathcal{O}(\text{nums1.length} + \text{nums2.length})$ solution?
