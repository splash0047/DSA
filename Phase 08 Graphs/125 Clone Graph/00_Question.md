## Problem Statement

Given a reference of a node in a **connected** undirected graph.

Return a **deep copy** (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a value (`int`) and a list (`List[Node]`) of its neighbors.

```cpp
class Node {
public:
    int val;
    vector<Node*> neighbors;
    Node() {
        val = 0;
        neighbors = vector<Node*>();
    }
    Node(int _val) {
        val = _val;
        neighbors = vector<Node*>();
    }
    Node(int _val, vector<Node*> _neighbors) {
        val = _val;
        neighbors = _neighbors;
    }
};
```

## Examples

### Example 1
```text
Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.
1st node (val = 1): neighbors 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
2nd node (val = 2): neighbors 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
3rd node (val = 3): neighbors 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
4th node (val = 4): neighbors 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
```

### Example 2
```text
Input: adjList = [[]]
Output: [[]]
Explanation: Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.
```

### Example 3
```text
Input: adjList = []
Output: []
Explanation: This an empty graph, it does not have any nodes.
```

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the graph is in the range $[0, 100]$.
- $1 \le \text{Node.val} \le 100$
- `Node.val` is **unique** for each node.
- There are no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
- The Graph is connected and all nodes can be visited starting from the given node.
