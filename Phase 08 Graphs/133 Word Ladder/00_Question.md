## Problem Statement

A **transformation sequence** from word `beginWord` to word `endWord` using a dictionary `wordList` is a sequence of words `beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk` such that:

- Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
- Every $s_i$ for $1 \le i \le k$ is in `wordList`. Note that `beginWord` does not need to be in `wordList`.
- $s_k == \text{endWord}$

Given two words, `beginWord` and `endWord`, and a dictionary `wordList`, return *the **number of words** in the **shortest transformation sequence** from `beginWord` to `endWord`, or `0` if no such sequence exists*.

## Examples

### Example 1
```text
Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
Output: 5
Explanation: One shortest transformation sequence is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog", which is 5 words long.
```

### Example 2
```text
Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
Output: 0
Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, so there is no valid transformation sequence.
```

## Constraints

- $1 \le \text{beginWord.length} \le 10$
- `endWord.length == beginWord.length`
- $1 \le \text{wordList.length} \le 5000$
- `wordList[i].length == beginWord.length`
- `beginWord`, `endWord`, and `wordList[i]` consist of lowercase English letters.
- `beginWord != endWord`
- All the words in `wordList` are **unique**.
