## Problem Statement

There is an integer array `nums` sorted in ascending order (with **distinct** values).

Prior to being passed to your function, `nums` is **possibly rotated** at an unknown pivot index `k` ($1 \le k < \text{nums.length}$) such that the resulting array is `[nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]` (**0-indexed**). For example, `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might be rotated at pivot index `3` and become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`.

Given the array `nums` after the possible rotation and an integer `target`, return *the index of `target` if it is in `nums`, or `-1` if it is not in `nums`*.

You must write an algorithm with $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ runtime complexity.

## Examples

### Example 1
```text
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
```

### Example 2
```text
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
```

### Example 3
```text
Input: nums = [1], target = 0
Output: -1
```

## Constraints

- $1 \le \text{nums.length} \le 5000$
- $-10^4 \le \text{nums}[i] \le 10^4$
- All values of `nums` are **unique**.
- `nums` is an ascending array that may have been rotated.
- $-10^4 \le \text{target} \le 10^4$
