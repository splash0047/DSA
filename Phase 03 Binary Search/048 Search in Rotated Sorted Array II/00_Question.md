## Problem Statement

There is an integer array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order (not necessarily with distinct values).

Before being passed to your function, `nums` is **rotated** at an unknown pivot index `k` ($0 \le k < \text{nums.length}$) such that the resulting array is `[nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]` (**0-indexed**). For example, `[0,1,2,4,4,4,5,6,6,7]` might be rotated at pivot index `5` and become `[4,5,6,6,7,0,1,2,4,4]`.

Given the array `nums` after the rotation and an integer `target`, return `true` *if `target` is in `nums`, or `false` if it is not in `nums`*.

You must decrease the overall operation steps as much as possible.

## Examples

### Example 1
```text
Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: true
```

### Example 2
```text
Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: false
```

## Constraints

- $1 \le \text{nums.length} \le 5000$
- $-10^4 \le \text{nums}[i] \le 10^4$
- `nums` is guaranteed to be rotated at some pivot.
- $-10^4 \le \text{target} \le 10^4$

## Follow-up

This problem is similar to **Search in Rotated Sorted Array**, but `nums` may contain **duplicates**. Would this affect the runtime complexity? How and why?
